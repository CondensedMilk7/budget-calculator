# BudgetCalculator

[Preview App]()

I built the app from a youtube video [tutorial](https://youtu.be/sU4z4Ti-8OQ), but with better practice, such as incorporating services for logic not related to visuals and less inline styling. Ultimately I ended up with less event listeners which should (hopefully) make the app lighter. I would add responsive styiling too but this bulma framework is giving me some trouble. I might get back to it.
