# BudgetCalculator

[Preview App](https://infallible-northcutt-15215f.netlify.app/)

I based the app on a youtube video [tutorial](https://youtu.be/sU4z4Ti-8OQ), but with better practice, such as incorporating services for logic not related to visuals, less inline styling and no overkill scss imports just for a few color variables. Ultimately I ended up with less event listeners, ngIf statements and smaller file sizes which should (hopefully) make the app lighter. I would add responsive styiling too but this bulma framework is giving me some trouble. I might get back to it.

I also added a new feature. You can change existing positive item amount value to negative and vice versa. In doing so, it will be moved to another list. This was a feature that was implemented with a lot of ngIf statements in the tutorial, hopefully I made a better alternative.
